# claymore v.11.0 no developer's fee
claymore dualminer v11 without developers fee 

This is v11 of Claymore Ethereum Miner with the DevFee removed

The "EthDcrMiner64.exe" is patched. You don't have to do anything, just start mining with the usual .bat

Once devfee mining is triggered it will mine to your address instead of developers. To make sure everything is working properly check the mining .txt logs for any "eth_submitLogin" where your address doesn't appear. If there are any then restart mining again and it should work properly. Otherwise contact me.

#FAQ 
Will it work for future releases of Claymore ?

-No I will have to update the releases manually.

Lower Hashrate than with original Claymore?

-Please run it for at least 12-24h, to make up for the downtime when you sitched to the no fee version and even out the usual volatility.
